## Story

On your 3rd birthday you wake up feeling weird. Your fur changes color and you develop strange glitch powers. You phase through walls, freeze people in place, and teleport for short periods of time. You're a `loophole` in the game, a fraud to your parents. They kick you out the house, forcing you to live in the wild. You must stay out of treacherous waters and away from hostile dogs by utilizing your loophole powers. As you proceed to live life, you realize that maybe your powers aren't all that bad.

## Notes

### Motivations and Difficulties
This was our first time using Godot and game development in general. We entered the [GMTK Game Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025/) and made this project to fit the "loop" theme. We encountered many difficulties that we're still trying to figure out, even after the project. Pushing and pulling with github was a headache, and there were points where we had to hard reset all our progress. While this game isn't the most polished, it's something we're all incredibly proud of. We've gained a lot of experience and will certainly ship a better product next gamejam.
